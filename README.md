A Number Guessing Game

This is a number guessing game. The user will guess a random number between 1 and 100. When they guess wrong, they are given clues to help them guess. Their attempts are recorded and they will get a summary at the end of the game that tells them how they did. They can choose to keep playing or exit the game after they guess the number.
